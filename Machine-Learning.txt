Exploratory Data Analysis:

types: 
------

		Univariate : single variable (age,height)
		
		Bivariate : two variables (M/F population, GRE scores based on age)

		Multivariate: more than two variables(Diabetes prediction using insulin, age, BMI)


Advantages of EDA:
-----------

		-> Arriving at data driven conclusions
		-> Checking for data anamolies and consistency
		-> Feature Engineering
		-> Data cleaning/preprocessing
		-> Handle underfitting/overfitting

Data visualisation: 
------------------- converting numerical and text data into graphs and reports

		-> Images are more appealing than texts
		-> Complex o/p cannot be understood easily
		
Data visualisation libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Graphs:
-------
	Barplot
	Pie chart
	Histogram
	Box plot
	Scatterplot
	Strip plot
